Feature: Signature validation

Scenario: Valid Token RS256
Given the user interacts with the site that implements the OidcProxy with a browser
  And the Oidc Server signs the JWT with RS256
  And the user has authenticated (navigated to /oauth2/sign_in)
  When the user navigates to /.auth/me
  Then the payload of the the ID_TOKEN is visible

Scenario: Valid Token HS256
Given the user interacts with the site that implements the OidcProxy with a browser
  And the Oidc Server signs the JWT with HS256
  And the OidcProxy is configured to use a symmetric key to validate the token signature
  And the user has authenticated (navigated to /oauth2/sign_in)
  When the user navigates to /oauth2/userinfo
  Then the payload of the the ID_TOKEN is visible
  
Scenario Outline: Tampered access_token RS256
Given the user interacts with the site that implements the OidcProxy with a browser
  And the Oidc Server signs the JWT with RS256
  And the Proxy receives a token with a <abuse-case>
  When the user has authenticated (navigated to /oauth2/sign_in)
  Then the endpoint responds with a 401 unauthorized
 Examples:
 | abuse-case                                                        |
 | payload that has been tampered with                               |
 | payload and header that has been tampered with                    |
 | payload that has been tampered with and no JWT header             |
 | payload that has been tampered with and two trailing JWT sections | # to make it seem like a JWE
 
Scenario: Tampered access_token anonymous access not allowed
Given the OidcProxy is configured to disallow anonymous access
  And the user interacts with the site that implements the OidcProxy with a browser
  And the Oidc Server signs the JWT with RS256
  And the Proxy receives a token that has been tampered with
 When the user navigates to /api/echo
 Then the endpoint responds with a 401 unauthorized
  
Scenario Outline: Tampered access_token RS256 during token refresh
Given the user interacts with the site that implements the OidcProxy with a browser
  And the Oidc Server signs the JWT with RS256
  And the user's access_token has expired
  And the Proxy receives a token with a <abuse-case>
  When the user invokes a downstream API
  Then the endpoint responds with a 401 unauthorized
 Examples:
 | abuse-case                                                        |
 | payload that has been tampered with                               |
 | payload and header that has been tampered with                    |
 | payload that has been tampered with and no JWT header             |
 | payload that has been tampered with and two trailing JWT sections | # to make it seem like a JWE

Scenario: Tampered access_token HS256
Given the user interacts with the site that implements the OidcProxy with a browser
  And the Oidc Server signs the JWT with HS256
  And the OidcProxy is configured to use a symmetric key to validate the token signature
  And the Proxy receives a token that has been tampered with
  When the user has authenticated (navigated to /oauth2/sign_in)
  Then the endpoint responds with a 401 unauthorized
